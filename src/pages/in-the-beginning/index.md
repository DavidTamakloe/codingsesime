Welcome To My Website! Yes there's not much here right now. But it's live! :)

### A little bit about me

My name's David Sesi Tamakloe. (Yes the domain is supposed to be a pun. Don't judge me). I'm a fullstack web developer based in Accra, Ghana (that's in West Africa). <br/>
I'm 26. The fact that I'm closer to 30 than 20 blows my mind daily.<br/>
My most recent binges include _Altered Carbon_, _Bojack Horseman_, _West World_ (I don't know what the hell season 2 was all about honestly).<br/>
I read every now and then. Currently reading _Outliers_ by Malcom Gladwell (that's a comforting book).<br/>
I like football.<br/>
Messi >= Ronaldo.<br/>
I will score you in any FIFA game before FIFA 18.

### As far as programming

These days I mostly code in **javascript**. I did a lot of **java** at one time, working with **android**. Worked at a company that used **Ruby on Rails** for about a year. I've played around with **ember.js**. I did some work in **sails.js**. Now I'm mostly working with **express.js**. I've done work with **mongoDB** and I prefer relational databases for projects; **postgresQL**, **mySQL**.. it's a much saner world.<br/>
Recently I've gotten into **React** and **React Native** (and I'm loving it. Infact this website is built with **Gatsby.js**. It's _Incredible_!)

### So what is this website

It looks rather bare right now, I know. I just got excited going through the gatsby.js tutorial and had to try it so here we are. If my design skills improve I'll add some style to it. For now enjoy the minimalist bliss.<br/>
I'm not entirely sure yet what'll go here. Obviously I'll be blogging about coding stuff as I learn. Maybe life/work stuff too, we'll see. Will there be a newsletter? Time go tell. (That's not a typo, it's [pidgin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghanaian_Pidgin_English)). In the mean time, thanks for stopping by!

PS: I get the feeling I'm kind of a good writer - or at least I've got potential. So feel free to contact me (_with cash_) for your writing needs.
